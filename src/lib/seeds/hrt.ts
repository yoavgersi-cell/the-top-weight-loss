// Menopause / HRT vertical content - thetopweightloss.com
//
// Launch content for the single-vertical HRT Women review site: online
// hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for women in perimenopause and menopause.
// Three providers: Winona (the anchor, async physician-led HRT), Gala (a
// flat-fee HRT + weight-management telehealth brand) and Midi Health (an
// insurance-billed, video-visit menopause clinic). Editorial is original and
// compliance-minded (YMYL): no cure or guarantee claims, no fabricated
// statistics, no "bioidentical is safer" claims, and every review is clear
// that HRT carries real risks and that suitability is a clinician decision.
//
// Facts checked (Sep 2026, via provider pages as surfaced in search results -
// the provider sites themselves could not be fetched directly):
//  - Winona: board-certified physicians; no video visit - online questionnaire
//    plus secure-portal messaging; estradiol (pill, patch, cream), estriol and
//    progesterone, vaginal estrogen cream; does NOT prescribe testosterone;
//    free shipping, unlimited follow-ups/messaging included in subscription;
//    non-HRT add-ons (e.g. sildenafil arousal cream, minoxidil, face cream).
//  - Gala (galaglp1.com/hormone-health - the same brand as Gala GLP-1):
//    US-licensed clinicians; estradiol pill or patch, oral or vaginal
//    progesterone, vaginal estradiol; flat monthly price, no insurance needed,
//    free shipping, messaging / check-ins / dose adjustments included; also
//    runs a GLP-1 weight-management program.
//  - Midi Health: ~30-min video visits with women's-health nurse practitioners
//    / certified nurse midwives; in-network with most major (PPO) insurance,
//    NOT Medicare (Medicare patients may pay self-pay); prescriptions sent to
//    your pharmacy of choice; hormonal and non-hormonal care plans;
//    testosterone out of pocket; also weight management, sexual wellness,
//    hair & skin.
//  - FDA: on Nov 10, 2025 the FDA announced it was requesting labeling
//    changes to remove the boxed warnings on cardiovascular disease, breast
//    cancer and probable dementia from menopausal hormone therapy products;
//    the endometrial-cancer boxed warning for systemic estrogen-alone products
//    was not removed.
//
// PLACEHOLDERS / OPERATOR TO VERIFY:
//  - No Trustpilot ratings/reviews are set - operator supplies later.
//  - All pricing is written as APPROXIMATE and clearly flagged; the operator
//    should confirm current figures against each provider's own checkout.
//    Gala's advertised starting price appeared as both ~$69 and ~$79/month in
//    different sources, so no single figure is asserted.
//  - State coverage is NOT asserted for any provider (Winona reportedly
//    excludes some states; Gala and Midi were described as nationwide only by
//    third-party sources). Set `excludedStates` once confirmed.
//  - Which Winona formulations are compounded vs FDA-approved products was not
//    confirmed - copy tells readers to ask their clinician.
//  - FDA label-change status: copy says the FDA "requested" changes (Nov 2025);
//    confirm the current labeling status before strengthening that wording.

        "A physician-led online menopause service that prescribes estrogen, progesterone and vaginal estrogen after an online intake - no video visit, with unlimited doctor messaging and free delivery.",
      reviewIntro:
        "Winona is one of the best-known online menopause brands, built around a simple idea: many women want expert HRT care without booking appointments. Instead of a video call, you complete a detailed online health questionnaire, a board-certified physician licensed in your state reviews it, and - if hormone therapy is appropriate for you - a personalized plan ships to your door. Ongoing care happens through secure messaging with your doctor. This review covers what Winona offers, what it costs and who it fits best.",
      keyFeatures: [
        "Board-certified physicians review every intake",
        "No video visit required - online questionnaire and secure messaging",
        "Estradiol in several forms (pill, patch, cream) plus progesterone",
        "Vaginal estrogen cream for dryness and urinary symptoms",
        "Unlimited follow-ups and doctor messaging included",
        "Free delivery to your door",
      ],
      pricingSummary:
        "Approximate only - confirm at checkout. Winona bills treatment as a monthly subscription that bundles the physician review, messaging and shipping. Published figures have started at roughly $39/month for progesterone alone, with common estrogen-plus-progesterone combinations landing higher - often somewhere around $89/month or more depending on the form and dose prescribed (patches tend to cost more than pills). Promotions and plans change, so verify the current price on Winona's own site before subscribing.",

        "Estradiol (oral pill, patch or cream - clinician-selected)",

      ],
      finalVerdict:
        "Winona is our top pick because it removes the biggest barrier to menopause care - getting an appointment - while keeping a board-certified physician in charge of every prescription. The online intake is detailed, messaging is unlimited, and the range of estrogen forms lets your doctor tailor treatment. The trade-offs are that it is self-pay only and never meets you by video, so women who want insurance billing or a live conversation may prefer an insurance-based clinic. Hormone therapy carries real risks - including blood clots, stroke and breast-cancer considerations - and it is not right for everyone, so answer the intake honestly and let the physician decide. Confirm current pricing before subscribing. This review is general information, not medical advice.",

It ranks just behind Winona, which offers a wider range of estrogen forms and a longer track record in menopause care. As with any HRT, the risks - including blood clots, stroke and breast-cancer considerations - are real and depend on your age, timing and history, so a clinician must decide whether it is right for you.

It behaves like a specialist practice: longer visits, a full Care Plan that can include non-hormonal options, and prescriptions at your own pharmacy. It ranks third because it is less convenient than an async subscription and costs are harder to predict until you check your plan.

That largely traces back to the <strong>Women's Health Initiative (WHI)</strong>, a large set of US trials whose early results, published in 2002, reported increased risks of breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and blood clots in women taking hormone therapy. Prescriptions fell dramatically afterward, and boxed warnings were added to product labels.</p><p>In the years since, researchers have re-examined that data. An important nuance: the WHI participants were, on average, in their 60s and many years past menopause - older than most women who start HRT for symptoms today. Later analyses suggested that the balance of risks and benefits looks different for younger women who start treatment closer to menopause.</p>`,

The agency pointed to evidence that the absolute risk of short-term HRT for hot flashes in younger women is low.</p><p>Two important caveats: the FDA did <strong>not</strong> remove the boxed warning about <strong>endometrial cancer</strong> for systemic estrogen-alone products (which is why women with a uterus are generally prescribed a progestogen alongside estrogen), and removing a boxed warning does <strong>not</strong> mean the risks disappeared.

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "What is HRT for menopause?",
      answer:
        "Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), also called menopausal hormone therapy, replaces some of the estrogen - and, for women with a uterus, progesterone - that the body makes less of during perimenopause and menopause. It is the most effective treatment for hot flashes and night sweats and can also help with sleep, vaginal dryness and bone health. Whether it is right for you depends on your age, symptoms and health history, so a licensed clinician should decide.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is HRT safe?",
      answer:
        "For many healthy women who start it before age 60 or within about 10 years of menopause, major medical societies consider HRT an appropriate option for bothersome symptoms. It does carry real risks, including blood clots, stroke and breast-cancer considerations, and it is generally not recommended for women with a history of certain cancers, blood clots, stroke or unexplained bleeding. In November 2025 the FDA announced it was requesting removal of several boxed warnings from menopausal HRT labels, but the risks remain part of the prescribing information.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get HRT online?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Licensed telehealth providers can evaluate you and prescribe HRT online. Some use a detailed online questionnaire reviewed by a physician; others use video visits. A legitimate service always has a licensed clinician review your health history before prescribing - a site that skips that step is a red flag.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does insurance cover online HRT?",
      answer:
        "It depends on the provider. Some online menopause clinics, such as Midi Health, are in-network with many commercial insurance plans for visits, with medication costs depending on your pharmacy benefit. Subscription services such as Winona and Gala are self-pay. Medicare coverage for telehealth menopause care varies by provider, so check before booking.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between an estrogen patch and a pill?",
      answer:
        "Both deliver estradiol, but pills pass through the liver first, which is associated with a higher risk of blood clots than transdermal forms like patches and gels. Patches avoid daily dosing but can irritate skin. Your clinician will recommend a route based on your health history and preferences.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are bioidentical hormones safer?",
      answer:
        "\"Bioidentical\" means chemically identical to the hormones your body makes, and FDA-approved bioidentical estradiol and progesterone are widely available. Compounded bioidentical hormones are custom-mixed and not FDA-approved, and the evidence does not show they are safer or more effective than FDA-approved products. Any estrogen carries the same class of risks.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need progesterone with estrogen?",
      answer:
        "If you have a uterus and take systemic estrogen, you generally need a progestogen such as progesterone to protect the uterine lining, because estrogen alone increases the risk of endometrial cancer. Women who have had a hysterectomy usually don't need it. Your clinician will decide what's appropriate.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are there non-hormonal options for menopause symptoms?",
      answer:
        "Yes. There are prescription non-hormonal treatments for hot flashes, as well as lifestyle approaches and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants for dryness. Non-hormonal options can be especially relevant for women who can't or prefer not to take hormones. A menopause-trained clinician can help you compare them.",
